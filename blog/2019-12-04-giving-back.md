The annual [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/) challenge encourages developers to give back to the open-source community by sending 24 pull requests between December 1st and December 24th. Last week, however, it was announced that 24 Pull Requests will be taking a break for 2019.

While I was sad to hear that 24 Pull Requests isn't happening this year, I still want to use the month of December as an opportunity to give back to the open-source tools that we use at Meeshkan. We're a small startup, so we greatly benefit from generous maintainers who choose to make their tools open and available.

But 24 pull requests between now and December 24th is... a lot. So I'm modifying the challenge a bit.

### 🎁 December 2019 Goal 🎁

In the spirit of the holidays, I will make at least one pull request per week to different tools that we use regularly at Meeshkan.

These pull requests could be 'little gifts of code' like the original challenge suggests or maybe I'll continue [my Hacktoberfest mission](https://dev.to/meeshkan/how-to-remove-condescending-language-from-documentation-4a5p) of removing condescending language from documentation. Who knows, let's see where this goes!

If you'd like to join me, here are some tools that we use at Meeshkan with open issues:
* [alex](https://github.com/get-alex/alex/issues)
* [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/issues)
* [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/issues)
* [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/labels/Help%20Wanted)
* [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues)
* [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues)
* [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues)
* [oclif](https://github.com/oclif/oclif/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen)
* [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
* [sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/issues)

You can also find more open-source initiatives on the [24 Pull Requests website](https://24pullrequests.com/).

Merry hacking 🥂
