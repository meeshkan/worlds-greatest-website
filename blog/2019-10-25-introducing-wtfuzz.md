Any other JavaScript developers out there feel like they can write tests, but don't necessarily understand the underlying concepts? 🙋‍♀️

Yeah, me too.

And this was exactly what I told my boss when I started as an Open Source Engineer at [Meeshkan](http://meeshkan.com/) earlier this month. I've been working as a frontend developer for the past two years and I've written _a lot_ of tests, but I never took the time to really learn the fundamentals.

A large part of my role at Meeshkan will be building and maintaining [Unmock](https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js), an open-source library to help you fuzz test your REST API calls. So because I will need to learn these things anyway, my boss was like... Why don't you create a YouTube series and learn out in the open?

My reaction: 😬😬😬😅 Ok! 

So that's why we're launching a new YouTube series called wtfuzz. The series will be a collection of 5-minute videos all about testing basics, a deep dive into fuzz testing, how to use unmock-js and whatever else pops up during my onboarding.

If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, please subscribe to the [Unmock YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBe00CDjCEe3LAhv3-TXIAw) and comment on this post with any topics you think we should cover. We'll also be publishing transcripts of each episode here on the [Meeshkan blog](http://meeshkan.com/blog/) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/unmock/).

See you on YouTube 👋
